## 🚀 What Exactly Am I Building?

I’m building a **full-stack web app** that helps people journal — something I call the **Sentiment-Aware Journaling System**.

It’s an app that uses **AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing)** to detect emotions from a person’s daily journal entries.
Think of it as your **digital emotional companion**, helping you track how you feel through your words.


### 💭 “But Kartik, why this… and not some easy chatbot using OpenAI’s API?”

Yeah… that would’ve been easier.
But would I really *learn* anything from that? Probably not.

I want to build something I’d be **proud of** — something challenging that pushes me to get at least **1% better every day**.



## 🧠 What Will It Actually Do?

Simple idea:

1. You write your thoughts daily.
2. The AI model analyzes your emotions.
3. The app visualizes your emotional trends over time — helping you see how your mood changes.

Basically, it’s like getting **small insights from your own mind.**



## ⚙️ Tech Stack (for now)

I’m learning as I go, so this may evolve, but here’s the current plan:

* **Frontend:** React — for a clean, simple journaling interface
* **Backend:** Django REST API — for user accounts and data management
* **Model Service:** FastAPI — to serve my NLP model (BERT / DistilBERT)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL — for storing journal entries
* **ML Models:** VADER (baseline) → Fine-tuned BERT on *GoEmotions* dataset

So yeah… it’s going to be a journey. 😅



## 🎯 My Goal

To document my entire progress — from **learning Django and APIs** to **deploying a real AI project.**

### Roadmap:

1. Learn Django & Build the Base App
2. Add NLP Model for Emotion Detection
3. Visualize Emotions with Graphs & Charts
4. Collect Real Feedback & Analyze Accuracy
5. Deploy Everything & Publish Research Paper

By the end, I aim to have:
✅ A working AI-powered journaling system
✅ A published research paper explaining it



## 🧩 Why Follow This Journey?

Because I know there are students out there who want to start something in AI — but when they see that huge mountain of technologies, they lose hope before even taking the first step.

I want to break that mountain into **small, doable steps**.
To show that you don’t need to know everything to begin — just **curiosity and consistency.**

If I can build this from scratch, **you can too.**
