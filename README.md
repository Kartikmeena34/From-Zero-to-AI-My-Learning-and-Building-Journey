# From-Zero-to-AI-My-Learning-and-Building-Journey


Hey everyone, I’m a final-year computer science student — not a topper, just someone genuinely excited about AI and what it can do. I want to build something around this for my major project, and maybe even kickstart my career in this field.

Do I already know AI? 🤔 Plain answer: NO. But that’s exactly why I’m starting this series — to learn, build, and share my progress step by step.

🎯 My Goal:

Learning ➜ Building ➜ Deploying an AI project

I’ll begin with Django to get comfortable with backend development, then move on to APIs, and after that… well, we’ll figure it out together. 🥲

🧠 By the end of this series, I aim to:

Get proficient with Django (Python).

Understand the basics of AI/ML and how to build simple models.

Learn how to connect AI with real-world applications.

Maybe even land a job in this field. 🥲
